<div id="main">
<p>The United States of America and India are two of the largest
democracies in the world, each with its own unique election system. The
previous stages performed data analysis on two countries election
datasets. In the last stage, we will compare and contrast two systems
based on previous analysis.</p>
<div id="two-party-vs.-multi-party" class="section level2">
<h2>Two Party vs. Multi Party</h2>
<p>In the United States, the political landscape is dominated by two
major parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. While
there are smaller third parties, these two parties have consistently
held a monopoly on political power. In contrast, India has a multi-party
system with numerous political parties, many of them are influential
locally. This has led to a highly fragmented political environment in
India, where coalitions between multiple parties are often formed in
order to secure a majority. The two-party system in the United States
provides a clear choice between two major platforms, while the
multi-party system in India can lead to a more diverse set of viewpoints
and agendas represented in government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, third parties in India and the United States play
a relatively minor role in their respective political systems comparing
to two giant parties. In India, there are numerous regional and smaller
parties that contest elections, but they rarely have a significant
impact at the national level. These parties often align with either the
ruling party or the opposition party, and their support can swing
elections in favor of one or the other. In the United States, third
parties such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have a small
but dedicated following, but they face significant barriers to entry due
to the country’s winner-takes-all electoral system. Third-party
candidates often struggle to gain access to televised debates or secure
significant campaign funding, making it difficult for them to gain
traction with voters. While third parties in both countries provide
voters with alternatives to the dominant political parties, their impact
on national politics remains limited.</p>
</div>
<div id="local-voting-patterns" class="section level2">
<h2>Local Voting Patterns</h2>
<p>The local vote pattern in the United States is generally more stable
than in India. In the US, local elections tend to be held separately
from national elections, which helps to create a more distinct local
political identity. Additionally, the two-party system in the US often
leads to a more stable and predictable local voting pattern. In India,
however, the lines between local and national politics are often
blurred, and the multiparty system makes it difficult to predict voting
patterns. These can be derived from <code>turning points</code> metric
in two countries, where the most states in USA keep voting for the same
party, but we hardly ever see this in India. The rise of regional
parties in India has also contributed to the volatility of local
politics. Overall, while local voting patterns in the US tend to be more
stable, there are still significant variations between regions and
states.</p>
</div>
<div id="election-size" class="section level2">
<h2>Election Size</h2>
<p>The size of elections in India and the USA varies significantly.
India has a much larger population than the USA, which means that the
number of voters in Indian elections is much higher. In the 2014 Lok
Sabha election, there are over 500 million voters as we saw in the
analysis. In contrast, we know the total population of the USA is still
far away from 400 million even right now. The average number of voters
in an assembly constituency is over 1 million in 2014 (there are more
than 500 assembly constituencies), while the battle state, Iowa, in the
United States had 1.6 million voters in 2020.</p>
